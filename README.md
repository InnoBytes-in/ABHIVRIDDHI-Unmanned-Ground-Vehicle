The Precision Farming Robot involves multidisciplinary design and development using recent technological innovations in artificial neural networks, computer vision, and 3DExperience Design & Simulation software. It is an autonomous robot to perform functional and analytical operations such as Soil Health Monitoring and Precision in-row Weed Identification and removal, crop diseases identification, detection, and optimized pesticide use for controlling crop disease. The purpose is to develop a general-purpose, sustainable robotic system to enhance crop yield and reduce agricultureâ€™s current dependency on herbicides thereby improving its impact on the environment.
